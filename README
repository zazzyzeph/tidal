# Tidal

This is my collection of sketches and startup files for [tidalcycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) 
BootTidal.hs and startup.scd make use of a number of tidalcycles and supercollider extensions (known as 'quarks' in SC) - each has their own installation instructions:
- [StageMaster](https://github.com/calumgunn/StageMaster)
- [mi-ugens](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/mi-ugens/)
- [MKPlugins](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/portedplugins)
